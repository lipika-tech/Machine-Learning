Problem Statement 
Dataset: KNN Dataset

 Import Libraries/Dataset
1.	Download the dataset
2.	Import the required libraries
1.	Data Visualization, Exploration, Pre-processing and cleaning
1.	Print 10 rows for sanity check to identify all the features present in the dataset
2.	Split the data as per 70:30 ratios of training and test set.
3.	Normalize the dataset and print 10 rows.

2.	Model Building 
1.	Define a function to return k- nearest neighbors
2.	Test the KNN Algorithm on the test dataset
3.	Repeat the procedure with different values of K and find the best value. 
4.	Justify how you will choose the best value
